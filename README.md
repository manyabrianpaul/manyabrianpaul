A retail company wants to sort a list of product IDs, ranging from 0 to 9999, to streamline inventory management. Due to the high volume, an efficient linear-time sorting approach is necessary. 
1. What advantages do counting sort and radix sort offer over traditional sorting methods for this specific range of product IDs? 2. Programming Task: 
Python: Implement a function `radix_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]` to sort product IDs in linear time. 
C++: Implement `vector<int> radixSort(vector<int>& arr);` to perform the same sorting.
